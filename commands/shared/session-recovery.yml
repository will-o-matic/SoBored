# session-recovery.yml - Session Recovery & Context Preservation

## Startup Detection
```yaml
scan_on_startup:
  locations:
    - ./claudedocs/tasks/in-progress/*.md
    - ./claudedocs/tasks/pending/*.md (overdue)
  
  parse_tasks:
    - extract metadata
    - check git branch status
    - identify next steps
    - restore context variables
    
  recovery_prompt:
    found_tasks: "Found {count} active tasks. Resume work?"
    no_tasks: "No active tasks found. Ready for new work."
    overdue: "Task {id} overdue. Continue or reschedule?"
```

## Context Preservation
```yaml
session_state:
  file_paths: currently modified files
  variables: important data & settings
  decisions: architectural choices made
  blockers: issues & solutions attempted
  
auto_save_triggers:
  - major code changes
  - before risky operations
  - session timeout warnings
  - manual /task:pause
  
context_format:
  ```yaml
  session_state:
    current_files: [path1, path2]
    key_variables:
      api_endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
      database_name: "myapp_prod"
    decisions:
      - "Used React over Vue for better team familiarity"
      - "Chose PostgreSQL for ACID compliance"
    blockers:
      - issue: "CORS error on API calls"
        attempted: ["added headers", "proxy setup"]
        solution: "needed server-side CORS config"
  ```
```

## Hybrid Recovery Process  
```yaml
step_1_identify:
  - scan ./claudedocs/tasks/in-progress/
  - parse task metadata
  - check git branch status
  - validate file existence
  - restore previous TodoWrite state

step_2_restore_both_systems:
  task_context:
    - load session context
    - summarize previous work
    - identify blocking issues
  todo_context:
    - regenerate TodoWrite from task breakdown
    - identify last completed todo
    - set current focus todo
    - preserve todo progress

step_3_seamless_resume:
  no_prompts: true
  auto_continue: true
  template: |
    Resuming {task_title} - working on: {current_todo}
    Progress: {completed_todos}/{total_todos} todos, {task_progress}% complete
    
hybrid_state_restoration:
  both_systems_sync:
    - task provides persistence
    - todos provide immediate focus
    - progress tracked in both
    - no duplication of effort
```

## Git Integration
```yaml
branch_tracking:
  - verify branch exists
  - check for uncommitted changes
  - identify merge conflicts
  - track remote status
  
checkpoint_restoration:
  - list available checkpoints
  - show diff since last checkpoint
  - offer rollback options
  - suggest merge strategies
```

## Session Break Handling
```yaml
graceful_pause:
  auto_triggers:
    - context >90% full
    - long inactivity
    - error thresholds
    
  pause_actions:
    - save current context
    - create git checkpoint
    - update progress status
    - log session summary
    
  resume_preparation:
    - validate environment
    - check dependencies
    - restore file states
    - prepare tools
```

## Multi-Task Management
```yaml
concurrent_tasks:
  max_active: 3
  priority_rules:
    - high priority blocks others
    - related tasks can be parallel
    - different areas can overlap
    
task_switching:
  - auto-save current context
  - create checkpoint
  - switch git branch
  - restore new context
  
conflict_resolution:
  - file modification conflicts
  - git merge requirements
  - dependency overlaps
  - resource constraints
```
