# Validation Patterns

## Pre-Execution Checks

```yaml
Always Validate:
  - Risky ops (delete, overwrite, deploy)
  - Prod changes
  - Permission escalations
  - External API calls

Check Sequence:
  1. Ambiguity: shared/ambiguity-check.yml
  2. Security: Path validation, secrets scan
  3. Deps: Required tools/libs exist
  4. Permissions: User has required access
  5. State: Clean working tree, no conflicts
```

## Risk Assessment

```yaml
Risk Score (1-10):
  Factors:
    Data loss potential: +3
    Irreversibility: +2
    Scope of impact: +2
    Security impact: +3
  
  Mitigations:
    Backup available: -2
    Test coverage: -1
    Sandbox mode: -2
    
Actions by Score:
  1-3: Proceed with note
  4-6: Warn and confirm
  7-9: Require explicit approval
  10: Block execution
```

## Integration

```yaml
Commands:
  Include: shared/validation.yml
  Call: validate_pre_execution()
  
Auto-Trigger:
  - Git push/force operations
  - File deletions
  - Database migrations
  - Production deployments
```
