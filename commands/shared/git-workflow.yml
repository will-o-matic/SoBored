# Git Workflow Integration

## Auto-Check
```yaml
Before Major Changes:
  - git status | Check for uncommitted changes
  - git branch | Verify correct branch
  - git fetch | Check for remote updates
  
Suggest Commits:
  - After feature completion
  - Before switching branches
  - At logical breakpoints
  
Conflict Detection:
  - Scan for merge conflict markers
  - Offer resolution patterns
  - Guide through conflict resolution
```

## Workflow Patterns
```yaml
Feature Work:
  New feature→Suggest feature branch
  Multiple changes→Suggest incremental commits
  Experimental→Suggest separate branch
  
Clean State:
  Uncommitted changes→"Commit first?" or "Stash?"
  Wrong branch→"Switch→feature branch?"
  Conflicts → "Resolve conflicts first"
  
Branch Awareness:
  main/master → Warn about direct changes
  feature/* → Encourage commits
  hotfix/* → Emphasize testing
```
