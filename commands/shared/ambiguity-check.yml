# Ambiguity Check Patterns

## Integration

```yaml
Commands:
  Include: shared/ambiguity-check.yml
  Check: ambiguity_level() before execute
  Block: CRITICAL ambiguity

Detection:
  Keywords: See RULES.md § Ambiguity
  Missing: Path|Scope|Criteria
  Risk: Combine w/ operation risk

Response:
  LOW: Proceed w/ assumption note
  MEDIUM: Suggest interpretation+confirm  
  HIGH: Present options A/B/C
  CRITICAL: Block until clarified
```

## Quick Checks

```yaml
Path Ambiguity:
  "update config" → Which file?
  "fix tests" → Which tests?
  "deploy" → Which environment?

Scope Ambiguity:
  "refactor" → Single file or module?
  "optimize" → Speed or memory?
  "add security" → What threats?

Action Ambiguity:
  "make it work" → Define "work"
  "fix the bug" → Which bug?
  "improve" → What aspect?
```
