## Error Classification & Response

```yaml
Severity_Levels:
  CRITICAL [10]: Data loss, security breach, prod down
    Response: Immediate stop, alert, rollback, incident response
    Recovery: Manual intervention required, full investigation
    
  HIGH [7-9]: Build failure, test failure, deployment issues
    Response: Stop workflow, notify user, suggest fixes
    Recovery: Automated retry w/ backoff, alternative paths
    
  MEDIUM [4-6]: Warning conditions, perf degradation
    Response: Continue w/ warning, log for later review
    Recovery: Attempt optimization, monitor for escalation
    
  LOW [1-3]: Info messages, style violations, minor optimizations
    Response: Note in output, continue execution
    Recovery: Background fixes, cleanup on completion

Error_Categories:
  Transient:
    Network_Timeouts: "MCP server unreachable, API timeouts"
    Resource_Busy: "File locked, system overloaded"
    Rate_Limits: "API quota exceeded, temporary blocks"
    Strategy: Exponential backoff retry, circuit breaker pattern
    
  Permanent:
    Syntax_Errors: "Invalid code, malformed input"
    Permission_Denied: "Access restrictions, auth failures"
    Not_Found: "Missing files, invalid paths"
    Strategy: No retry, immediate fallback or user guidance
    
  Context:
    Configuration: "Missing env vars, incorrect settings"
    State_Conflicts: "Dirty working tree, merge conflicts"
    Version_Mismatch: "Incompatible versions, deprecated APIs"
    Strategy: Validation, helpful error msgs, setup guidance
    
  Resource:
