# Task UltraCompressed Format Configuration

## Format Rules
```yaml
activation:
  automatic: true for all task operations
  exceptions: none - always use compressed format
  
compression_rules:
  remove_words:
    - the, a, an, is, are, was, were
    - in, on, at, to, for, of, with
    - that, which, this, these
  
  abbreviations:
    status: S | priority: P | implementation: impl
    configuration: cfg | documentation: docs
    authentication: auth | database: db
    architecture: arch | development: dev
    production: prod | dependencies: deps
    
  symbols:
    →: leads to / results in
    &: and / with
    w/: with / including
    w/o: without
    ✓: completed
    □: pending
    ⚠: blocked
    
structure:
  title_line: "T: {title}"
  metadata_line: "ID: {id} | S: {status} | P: {priority}"
  branch_line: "Branch: {branch}"
  phases: bullet list with symbols
  context: key:value pairs
  progress: percentage and todo count
```

## Task File Template
```yaml
header: |
  # Legend: → leads to | & and | w/ with | S: status | P: priority | ✓ done | □ pending
  
  T: {title}
  ID: {id} | S: {status} | P: {priority}
  Branch: {branch}

phases: |
  ## Phases
  {phase_list}

context: |
  ## Context
  Dec: {decisions}
  Block: {blockers}
  Files: {files}
  Next: {next_step}

progress: |
  ## Progress
  Todos: {active}/{total}
  Complete: {percentage}%
```

## Conversion Examples
```yaml
verbose_to_compressed:
  before: "Create user authentication system with JWT tokens"
  after: "T: User auth system w/ JWT"
  
  before: "Status: in-progress, Priority: high"
  after: "S: in-progress | P: high"
  
  before: "Implementation phase is currently blocked by CORS configuration"
  after: "Impl phase blocked: CORS cfg"
  
  before: "Decision made: Use PostgreSQL for database"
  after: "Dec: PostgreSQL for db"
```

## Benefits
```yaml
token_savings: ~70% reduction
readability: maintained through legend
consistency: enforced format across all tasks
scanning: easier to find key information
```
