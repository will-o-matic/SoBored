# Notion Database Schema Update for Multi-Date Support

## Overview

Successfully updated the Notion database schema to include dedicated fields for multi-date event series functionality, replacing the previous approach of embedding series information in the Description field.

## ✅ Schema Changes Applied

### New Fields Added

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| **Series ID** | Rich Text | Unique identifier linking events in a multi-session series |
| **Session Number** | Number | Which session this is in the series (1, 2, 3, etc.) |
| **Total Sessions** | Number | Total number of sessions in this series |
| **Recurrence** | Rich Text | RFC 5545 RRULE for recurring events (future feature) |

### Updated Source Options
- Added "pipeline" source option for Smart Pipeline-generated events

### Current Database Schema (14 properties total)

- ✅ **Title** (title) - Event name
- ✅ **Date/Time** (date) - Event date and time
- ✅ **Location** (rich_text) - Event venue/location
- ✅ **Description** (rich_text) - Event description
- ✅ **Source** (select) - telegram, web, email, instagram, pipeline
- ✅ **URL** (url) - Source URL if applicable
- ✅ **Classification** (select) - event, url, text, image, unknown
- ✅ **Status** (select) - new, processed, archived
- ✅ **UserId** (rich_text) - User who submitted the event
- ✅ **Added** (date) - Timestamp when record was created
- 🆕 **Series ID** (rich_text) - Links multi-session events
- 🆕 **Session Number** (number) - Session position in series
- 🆕 **Total Sessions** (number) - Total sessions in series
- 🆕 **Recurrence** (rich_text) - Future RRULE support

## 🔧 Code Updates Applied

### 1. Updated Save Tools
- **`save_notion_tool.py`**: Uses dedicated series fields instead of description embedding
- **`dry_run_save_notion_tool.py`**: Consistent with real save tool for testing

### 2. Enhanced Property Builder
Updated `_build_notion_properties()` function with new parameters:
```python
def _build_notion_properties(
    # ... existing parameters ...
    series_id: Optional[str] = None,
    session_number: Optional[int] = None,
    total_sessions: Optional[int] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### 3. Schema Management
- **`utils/notion_client.py`**: Updated schema definition
- **`update_notion_schema.py`**: New script for schema migrations

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Embedded in Description)
```
Description: "Workshop series on Machine Learning

🔗 Series: abc123 | Session 1 of 3"
```

### After (Dedicated Fields)
```
Description: "Workshop series on Machine Learning"
Series ID: "abc123"
Session Number: 1
Total Sessions: 3
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Clean Data Structure**: Series metadata in proper database fields
2. **Better Filtering**: Can filter/sort by session number, total sessions
3. **Improved Queries**: Native database queries for series-related operations
4. **Future-Proof**: Foundation for recurring event support (RRULE)
5. **Analytics Ready**: Structured data for reporting and analysis

## 🚀 Impact on Multi-Date Processing

### Smart Pipeline Integration
- Multi-date events automatically populate series fields
- Session titles indicate position: "Event Name (Session 1 of 3)"
- Series linking enables related event discovery

### Evaluation Framework
- Evaluation tests can validate proper series field population
- Performance tracking for multi-session event creation
- Quality assurance for series linking accuracy

### User Experience
- Cleaner event descriptions without embedded metadata
- Native Notion filtering and sorting capabilities
- Better visualization of event series in database views

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test Multi-Date Events**: Verify new schema works with Smart Pipeline
2. **Update Documentation**: Reflect new schema in user guides
3. **Create Database Views**: Leverage new fields for better organization
4. **Plan RRULE Support**: Use Recurrence field for future recurring events

## 📝 Tool Architecture Update (2025-06-25)

Following the schema update, the Notion tools were refactored to eliminate code duplication:

### Changes Made
- **Unified Tool**: `save_to_notion` now handles both real and dry-run modes
- **Removed Duplication**: `dry_run_save_to_notion` tool deleted (400+ lines eliminated)
- **Environment Control**: `DRY_RUN=true/false` controls save behavior
- **Single Source**: All Notion save logic now in `NotionSaver` class

### Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Schema changes only need updates in one place
- **Testing**: `DRY_RUN=true` enables safe testing with new schema
- **Consistency**: Real and mock saves use identical logic
